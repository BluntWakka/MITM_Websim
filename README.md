Idea of project is to encrypt a user provided piece of data with different encryption schemes and 
simulate what an attacker could do if they intercepted. 

Essentially, this project is a roundabout way of testing various encryption schemes for security
given only the ciphertext (and maybe public key if it is pertinent to the scheme)

Currently want to include JavaScript that calls to compiled Java files for some methods and 
utilize CSS and HTML for formatting
