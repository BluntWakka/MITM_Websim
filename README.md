Idea of project is to encrypt a user provided piece of data with different encryption schemes and 
simulate what an attacker could do if they intercepted. 

Essentially, this project is a roundabout way of testing various encryption schemes for security
given only the ciphertext (and maybe public key if it is pertinent to the scheme)

Currently want to include JavaScript that utilizes CSS and HTML for formatting

Previously made java code that goes through some of the encryption options present in the javascript will be included in the repository for the sake of comparison of ease.
